# [Advent Of Code 2022]

My solutions for each task.

Goals and Non-Goals are same as last year:

## Goals

- Solve the puzzles.
- Solve them as quickly as possible.
- (optional) Refactor if something bothers me too much.
- Yet still: Have fun with the puzzles!
- Enjoy the coding practice and built up the "muscle memory" for Rust.
- Learn more Rust on the way.
- Become more confident.
- Allow rough edges here and there.
- Have fun!

## Non-Goals

- Performance and efficiency.¹
- The most, best, optimal, idiomatic way of writing Rust.²
- Perfectionism.
- Competition.

¹ _Unless the task at hand requires it._
² _Well, a bit of idiomatic code is probably still good._

## Setup

- multiple binaries, one for each day
- binary name must include day value
- prepare task: create files and fetch input (needs session cookie)
- each day: create bin file, compile, prepare run, code solution, puzzle run
